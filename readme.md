# My Developer Roadmap

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my developer roadmap!

## The idea

ðŸ’¡ I've created this repository to help me visualize my learning journey, to gather all the different resources I come across in one place and to organize the notes I'm taking along the way.

## The structure

ðŸ“ˆ The structure that I'm using to organize my thoughts, learnings and resources follows my own logic so far. The most important thing for me was to have something visual which is why I chose to use Foam (https://foambubble.github.io/foam) as the tool to organize everything.
